Tablet weaving app prototype for my own use. User interface is heavily inspired by the awesome
[Twisted Threads](https://twistedthreads.org) by [Shelagh Lewins](https://github.com/Shelagh-Lewins),
which, however, has very little keyboard support and is a tad slow when designing patterns.

**This is very much a work in progress!**
